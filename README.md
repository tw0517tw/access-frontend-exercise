## Extra assumptions I made to Exercise Document

### GitHub API document location change

GitHub API documentation links is present in exercise document as below, but the actual document page has been moved to another location.
> ‚Ä¢ List - <https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-all-users>  
> ‚Ä¢ Pagination - <https://developer.github.com/v3/#link-header>  
> ‚Ä¢ Detail <https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-a-single-user>  

I use these document page as GitHub API reference instead.
> List - <https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users/users#list-users>  
> Pagination - <https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#link-header>  
> Detail - <https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users/users#get-a-user>  

### About README.txt

For layout convenience, I use markdown format so this is a `README.md` instead of a `.txt` file.

### About `site_admin` property

I'm not sure what does `site_admin` property in GitHub API response means. I just make that showing a üåü for users with `site_admin: true` and a ‚≠ê for those who are not `site_admin` in the List page.

### About Redux

I'm using `react-query` as API state manager, so using `redux` is not necessary in this project.

## Time Spent

- Read exercise document and related API documents for initial design ideas: about 2 hours
- Implement basic dummy List frontend page without API calls: about 4 hours
- Setup react-query and add API calls to retrieve real data: about 2 hours
- Add UserPage to show single User profile: about 1 hour
- Minor UI/UX tweak: about 1 hour
- Update README: about 30 minutes
