## Correction to Exercise Document

GitHub API documentation links is present in exercise document as below, but the actual document page has been moved to another location.
> • List - <https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-all-users>
> • Pagination - <https://developer.github.com/v3/#link-header>
> • Detail <https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-a-single-user>

I use these document page as GitHub API reference instead.
> List - <https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users/users#list-users>
> Pagination - <https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#link-header>
> Detail - <https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users/users#get-a-user>

## Time Spent

- Read exercise document and related API document: about 2hr
- Implement basic dummy frontend page without API calls: 
- Setup react-query and add API calls to retrieve real data:
